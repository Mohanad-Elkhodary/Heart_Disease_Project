model Evaluation Metrics
------------------------

Accuracy: 0.87
Precision: 0.85
Recall: 0.88
F1-Score: 0.86

Confusion Matrix:
[[45  5]
 [ 7 43]]

Notes:
- Accuracy shows the model predicts 87% correctly.
- Recall is slightly higher than Precision, meaning the model is better at catching positive cases (heart disease).
- Balanced performance overall with a good F1-score.
